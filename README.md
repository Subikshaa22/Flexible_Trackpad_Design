# Flexible Trackpad Design Using PSoC 4100S Plus and CapSense

**This is an ongoing project and all the details have not yet been implemented**

## Project Overview

This project implements a flexible trackpad using the PSoC 4100S Plus microcontroller with CapSense technology. The objective is to create a touch-sensitive trackpad capable of detecting finger gestures, touch positions, and movement across a flexible surface. The PSoC 4100S Plus family is chosen for its integrated CapSense touch technology, low power consumption, and flexibility, making it ideal for trackpad applications in modern input devices.

## Features

- **CapSense Multi-Touch Support**: Detect multiple touch points, finger movement, and gestures like swipe, tap, and pinch.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized power modes suitable for battery-powered applications.
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Configurable touch sensitivity through CapSense tuning.
- **Flexible PCB**: Designed for integration with flexible printed circuit boards, allowing for curved surfaces and customizable shapes.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Basic recognition of gestures like swipe, zoom, and tap.

## Hardware Requirements

1. **PSoC 4100S Plus (CY8CKIT-149) Prototyping Kit**
   - Core: ARM® Cortex®-M0+
   - CapSense touch-sensing technology
2. **Flexible PCB** with touch sensor array (or custom trackpad layout using CapSense buttons/sliders)
3. **CapSense Touchpad Elements**: Can be designed using conductive ink, copper traces, or flexible conductive materials.
4. **USB Interface**: To communicate the touch data with a PC or other host systems.
5. **Power Supply**: USB-powered or battery-powered (e.g., 3.7V LiPo battery).

## Software Requirements

1. **PSoC Creator 4.4**
   - IDE for developing and debugging the firmware for PSoC microcontrollers.
   - Includes the CapSense Component for configuring touch sensors and processing touch events.
   
2. **CapSense Tuner Tool**
   - Used for tuning and debugging the touch sensitivity and performance of the trackpad.
   
3. **Bridge Control Panel**
   - For data visualization, allowing real-time monitoring of touch positions and gestures.
